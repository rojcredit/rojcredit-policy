  <h1>Privacy Policy for RojCredit</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> November 2025</p>

  <p>RojCredit (“we”, “us”, “our”) operates the RojCredit mobile application (“App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, store, and protect information when you use the App.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We may collect the following types of information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Authentication & Contact Data:</strong> Your phone number (used for login), user ID, and optionally your email if you provide it.</li>
    <li><strong>Business & Profile Data:</strong> Business name, category, GST number, Udyam number, address, logo/image URI, and other profile details you choose to provide.</li>
    <li><strong>Transaction & Usage Data:</strong> Data about your entries, records, ledger transactions, date/time stamps, metadata about how you use the App.</li>
    <li><strong>Device & Technical Data:</strong> Device identifiers, operating system, version, network information, app version, crash reports, and performance analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud Storage Data:</strong> Data that you store or sync in the cloud via Firebase or other services.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <p>We use your data for the following purposes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Creating and maintaining your account, business profile, and login securely.</li>
    <li>Storing and syncing your business, customer, and transaction data in the cloud so that you can access it across devices.</li>
    <li>Improving the App, diagnosing issues, monitoring performance, and responding to support requests.</li>
    <li>Personalizing your experience, tailoring features based on your usage (if you opt-in).</li>
    <li>Ensuring security, fraud prevention, abuse detection, and protecting your data.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Information Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
  <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information under the following conditions:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>With our service providers (for example Firebase / Google Cloud) who assist us with storage, analytics, or infrastructure. These parties are required to keep your data secure and use it only for the purposes we specify.</li>
    <li>When required by law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.</li>
    <li>In connection with a business transition (merger, acquisition, asset sale) — with notice to you as required by law.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Storage, Security & Retention</h2>
  <p>Your data is stored on secure cloud infrastructure (for example Google Firebase). We implement industry-standard encryption for data in transit and at rest, authentication mechanisms, and other reasonable safeguards.</p>
  <p>We retain your account data for as long as your account is active. If you request account deletion (see below), we will delete your data unless we have a lawful reason to retain it (for example for fraud prevention or accounting purposes). If we retain data, we will inform you of the retention period.</p>

  <h2>5. Your Rights & Choices</h2>
  <p>You may access, update or delete your profile and business information within the App. If you wish to have your account and associated data permanently deleted, you may contact us at <a href="mailto:rojcredit.help@gmail.com">rojcredit.help@gmail.com</a> and we will process your request. Once deletion is completed, you will no longer have access to the data and we will stop processing it (unless required by law).</p>

  <h2>6. Third-Party Services & SDKs</h2>
  <p>The App uses third-party services such as <a href="https://firebase.google.com" target="_blank">Firebase by Google</a> for authentication and cloud storage. These services may collect and process certain information as described in their respective privacy policies.</p>

  <h2>7. Children & Minors</h2>
  <p>The App is intended for users who are at least 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware of data collected from a child under 13 without proper consent, we will take steps to delete such data.</p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we make changes, we will revise the “Effective Date” and post the updated version on this page. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
